# Problem 1: Basic SELECT Query

# Problem: Select American Cities with Population Greater Than 100,000.

## Objective
Write an SQL query to select all columns for every American city in the `CITY` table that has a population 
larger than 100,000. The CountryCode for America is 'USA'.

## Problem Statement
Given a table named CITY with the following columns:
- ID
- NAME
- COUNTRYCODE
- DISTRICT
- POPULATION

Task is to retrieve all columns for cities where:
- CountryCode equals 'USA', and
- Population is greater than 100000.

## Approach and Solution
- Use the 'SELECT' statement to retrieve all columns.
- Use the 'WHERE' clause to filter out records where population is greater than 100000.
